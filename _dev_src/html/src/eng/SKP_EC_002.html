          Document screening is based on comprehensive consideration of applicants' experience and qualifications. Please take careful consideration based on your aptitude and job suitability before selecting the field you would like to apply for. SKCT is an evaluation to assess the basic qualities required by SK, such as ‘spirit (active thinking, progressive behavior, detail-oriented and flawless execution), knowledge of business administration, sociability, and job performance’. After the first interview, the applicant’s expertise, job comprehension, job performance, potential, company view, and enthusiasm are assessed in depth during the second round of interviews to evaluate whether the talent can grow with the company. Those who have passed the final interview will have a health examination. The health examination is held to determine the capability of regular work performance.
