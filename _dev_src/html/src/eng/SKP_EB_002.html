          Weatherpong is an application that provides real-time weather information based on the user's current location or from a 1 to 2 km radius of an area of interest. It shows per-minute real-time information such as temperature, rainfall, rain probability, wind speed, cloud distribution, and humidity, by integrating the only domestic tightly-knitted weather observation network to have more than 1,000 sensors in the metropolitan area and the information from the Meteorological Agency. ‘Pong’, the character that expresses emotions according to the weather, delivers weather information in a more exciting and differentiated way. Moreover, it provides detailed weather conditions such as fine dust, ultraviolet rays, sunset, sunrise, hourly and daily forecasts, and more. In the event of special weather reports such as typhoons, heightened fine dust levels, etc., it alerts with pop-ups, providing customer convenience. Weatherpong is available for download on One Store, Google Play, and the Apple App Store regardless of your mobile carrier.
